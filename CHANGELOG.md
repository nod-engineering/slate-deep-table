# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [0.9.6] - 2019-7-9

## [0.9.5] - 2019-7-8

- now exports a function to obtain default serializer rules; see comment https://github.com/jasonphillips/slate-deep-table/issues/18#issuecomment-509439219

## [0.9.1] - 2019-7-8

- compatibility with Slate 0.46.x

## [0.8.0] - 2018-11-2

- compatibility with slate 0.43.x (thanks @eugene-preply )

### Breaking

- Slate now hoists exported commands and queries to functions callable directly on the Editor instance. So instead of invoking e.g. `plugin.utils.insertTable()` you will now call it directly on your editor, eg. `editor.insertTable()`. See the tests for more examples.
- added `isSelectionInTable()` as an exported query
- renamed some commands for more specificity to ensure they don't collide with other plugins:
  - `moveSelection()` -> `moveTableSelection()`
  - `moveSelectionBy()` -> `moveTableSelectionBy()`
  - `toggleHeaders()` -> `toggleTableHeaders()`

## [0.7.0] - 2018-10-7
